# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

**iris** is a live terminal supervisor (TUI) for every active Claude Code session. It reads the transcript files Claude Code writes under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`, tails the active ones, and renders a single dashboard: per-session status, model, tokens, estimated cost, a live activity feed, a tool-usage histogram, opt-in AI summaries, and remote approve/deny of pending tool calls.

It is published on crates.io as **`iris-tui`** (the binary is `iris`) — single static Rust binary, no daemon, no config beyond an optional approval hook. Releases are tag-driven: bump `Cargo.toml`, add a `CHANGELOG.md` section, push a `v*` tag.

- [README.md](./README.md) is the 1-minute pitch, the key map, and the progress checklist.
- [docs/index.html](./docs/index.html) is the GitHub Pages landing page.

## Build & run

```bash
cargo run                 # live TUI
cargo run -- ls           # one-shot table, no TUI
cargo build --release     # optimized binary (LTO, codegen-units=1, stripped)
cargo install --path .    # install `iris` to ~/.cargo/bin
```

## Architecture

`main.rs` is the CLI entry, arg parser, and the crossterm event loop (all key handling lives there). Modules under `src/`:

- `app.rs` — application state and all the actions the event loop calls (selection, focus, summaries, approvals, key entry).
- `ui.rs` — all ratatui rendering: sessions list, detail pane, modals, status glyphs, token/cost formatting.
- `session.rs` — discovers and parses transcript `.jsonl` files into session models (usage, model, activity, pending tool calls).
- `bridge.rs` — the `PreToolUse` hook bridge, the heartbeat file, and `install-hook` / `uninstall-hook` settings.json editing.
- `anthropic.rs` — the only network code: AI "doing / done / next" summaries and tool-call risk reads.
- `cost.rs` — per-model USD pricing constants and cost estimation.

When adding code, match this module split rather than inventing a new structure. Key handling stays in `main.rs`'s `event_loop`; state mutations stay as methods on `App`.

## Non-negotiable product principles

These are the product's contract — any change must respect them:

- **Read-only over transcripts.** iris tails the files Claude Code writes; it never modifies them.
- **Local-first.** The ONLY outbound network requests are the AI summary (`s`) and risk read (`x`), and only on demand. No telemetry, no remote config. Don't add background network calls.
- **Never hang a session.** The hook checks a heartbeat file; if iris isn't running (stale heartbeat) or gating is disarmed, it must instantly defer to Claude Code's normal permission flow. Never let the hook block on a dashboard that isn't up.
- **Opt-in interception.** Approval gating is off until armed (`A`) and disarms automatically when iris exits.
- **Key safety.** The Anthropic API key is entered in-app (`K`) and written `0600`. Never log it or commit it.

If a task seems to require violating one of these, stop and confirm with the user — they are hard constraints, not defaults.

## Conventions

- Cost figures are **estimates** by design. Pricing lives as editable constants in `cost.rs`; adjust there, don't hardcode numbers elsewhere.
- `Cargo.lock` is committed on purpose — iris is a binary, not a library.

## Parent context

This project lives under `_tooling/` in the Itzenata workspace. The parent [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) describes unrelated standalone scripts in that directory; they share no build system with iris. The sibling `vault-doctor/` project established the repo conventions this project follows (README badges, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, GitHub Pages landing under `docs/`, MIT license).
